Today’s Internet is arguably the largest engineered system ever created by  mankind,  with hundreds of millions of connected computers, communication links, and  switches; with billions of users who connect via laptops, tablets, and smartphones;  and with an array of new Internet-connected “things” including game consoles, surveillance systems, watches, eye glasses, thermostats, and cars. Given that the Internet is so large and has so many diverse components and uses, is there any hope of  understanding how it works? Are there guiding principles and structure that can  provide a foundation for understanding such an amazingly large and complex system? And if so, is it possible that it actually could be both interesting and fun to  learn about computer networks? Fortunately, the answer to all of these questions is  a resounding YES! Indeed, it’s our aim in this book to provide you with a modern  introduction to the dynamic field of computer networking, giving you the principles and practical insights you’ll need to understand not only today’s networks, but  tomorrow’s as well. This first chapter presents a broad overview of computer networking and the  Internet. Our goal here is to paint a broad picture and set the context for the rest  of this book, to see the forest through the trees. We’ll cover a lot of ground in this  introductory chapter and discuss a lot of the pieces of a computer network, without  losing sight of the big picture. We’ll structure our overview of computer networks in this chapter as follows.  After introducing some basic terminology and concepts, we’ll first examine the basic  hardware and software components that make up a network. We’ll begin at the network’s edge and look at the end systems and network applications running in the  network. We’ll then explore the core of a computer network, examining the links
