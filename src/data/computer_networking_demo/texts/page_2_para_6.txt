The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices  throughout the world. Not too long ago, these computing devices were primarily  traditional desktop computers, Linux workstations, and so-called servers that store  and transmit information such as Web pages and e-mail messages. Increasingly,  however, users  connect to the Internet with smartphones and tablets—today, close  to half of the world’s population are active mobile Internet users with the percentage  expected to increase to 75% by 2025 [Statista 2019]. Furthermore, nontraditional  Internet “things” such as TVs, gaming consoles, thermostats, home security systems,  home appliances, watches, eye glasses, cars, traffic control systems, and more are  being connected to the Internet. Indeed, the term computer network is beginning to  sound a bit dated, given the many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to  the Internet. In Internet jargon, all of these devices are called hosts or end systems.  By some estimates, there were about 18 billion devices connected to the Internet in  2017, and the number will reach 28.5 billion by 2022 [Cisco VNI 2020].
