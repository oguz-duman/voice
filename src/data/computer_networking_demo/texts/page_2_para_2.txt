and the switches that transport data, as well as the access networks and physical  media that connect end systems to the network core. We’ll learn that the Internet is  a network of networks, and we’ll learn how these networks connect with each other. After having completed this overview of the edge and core of a computer network, we’ll take the broader and more abstract view in the second half of this chapter. We’ll examine delay, loss, and throughput of data in a computer network and  provide simple quantitative models for end-to-end throughput and delay: models  that take into account transmission, propagation, and queuing delays. We’ll then  introduce some of the key architectural principles in computer networking, namely,  protocol layering and service models. We’ll also learn that computer networks are  vulnerable to many different types of attacks; we’ll survey some of these attacks and  consider how computer networks can be made more secure. Finally, we’ll close this  chapter with a brief history of computer networking.
